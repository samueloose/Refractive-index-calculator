# Refractive-index-calculator
This is an interactive python program which let you calculate the refracrive index of any material. It needs to know the angles of incidence and the angles of refraction and the resolution of the instrument (as a goniometer) that you have used to misurate the angles.
The program makes a linear fit (using the Snell's Law as model) which is based on the ODR (Ortogonal Distance Regression) method (from "scipy.odr")
